BTC: Bitcoin, as expected, has the highest mean price among the listed cryptocurrencies, indicating its dominance in the market. The large gap between the mean and median price suggests a wide distribution of prices, likely influenced by significant price spikes or drops over time. Despite this, its volatility is relatively low (0.0426), indicating that, while it experiences price fluctuations, it is more stable compared to other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin or Solana.
ETH: Ethereum shows a notable difference between its mean and median prices, indicating some level of price skewness or extreme values. The volatility of 0.0630 is higher than Bitcoin's, suggesting that Ethereum experiences more frequent or more significant price fluctuations. Ethereum's position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is reflected in its relatively high price and moderate volatility.
SOL: Mean Price: $10.47
Median Price: $2.88
Volatility: 0.0945
Analysis: Solana has a low mean price, suggesting it is a more affordable cryptocurrency with potentially high growth prospects. However, the volatility of 0.0945 indicates that it is one of the more unstable cryptocurrencies, with significant price swings. The disparity between the mean and median price implies that Solana's price is often skewed by outliers or dramatic changes.
Binance Coin (BNB): Mean Price: $52.25
Median Price: $16.21
Volatility: 0.0800
Analysis: Binance Coin presents a moderate mean price compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but like the others, it also shows a significant difference between the mean and median prices, pointing to periods of high price volatility. The volatility of 0.0800 is relatively high, suggesting that while Binance Coin is generally stable, it can experience substantial fluctuations, likely due to its connection to the Binance exchange and broader market conditions.




01. Correlation Matrix
Purpose: The correlation matrix was utilized to analyze the relationships between key variables (Close price, Volume, and Marketcap) for each targeted cryptocurrency.
Explanation: By calculating the correlation coefficients, the matrix highlights how closely these variables move together. For example, a strong positive correlation between Close price and Marketcap is expected, as Marketcap is directly influenced by the price. Conversely, the correlation between Volume and Marketcap can provide insights into market activity and its impact on a cryptocurrency’s valuation. This analysis helps to understand the underlying dynamics between different factors that influence the performance of the cryptocurrency.
02. Box Plot
Purpose: The box plot was employed to provide a detailed quantitative view of each cryptocurrency's performance, particularly focusing on price distribution.
Explanation: The box plot displays the spread and skewness of the cryptocurrency prices by showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. This visualization helps identify the range of typical prices, the consistency of the cryptocurrency’s performance, and any anomalies (e.g., extreme highs or lows). By visualizing the distribution of prices, stakeholders can gain insights into the stability or volatility of the cryptocurrency, aiding in making informed decisions based on historical performance data.


Bitcoin Closing Prices Over Time
Time Span: The graph displays Bitcoin's closing prices from around 2013 to 2021.
Price Trend:
Early Period (2013-2016): Bitcoin’s price remained relatively low, with minor fluctuations, reflecting its nascent stage in the market and lower adoption levels.
2017 Bull Run: A significant upward trend begins in 2017, culminating in a sharp spike in price towards the end of the year. This was the first major bull run for Bitcoin, where it gained mainstream attention and hit nearly $20,000 before experiencing a significant correction in early 2018.
2018-2020: After the 2017 peak, Bitcoin’s price went through a prolonged period of correction, known as the "crypto winter," where prices fell and stabilized at lower levels.
2020-2021 Rally: Starting in late 2020, Bitcoin experienced another sharp rise, reaching new all-time highs in 2021, driven by factors such as institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns, and increasing interest from retail investors. The price reached around $60,000, showcasing its volatile nature and potential for rapid growth.
Ethereum Closing Prices Over Time
Time Span: The graph illustrates Ethereum's closing prices from its inception in 2015 up to around 2019.
Price Trend:
Early Period (2015-2016): Ethereum’s price was very low during its initial years, as it was still relatively unknown and in the process of establishing its platform and use cases.
2017 Bull Run: Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum saw a significant price increase in 2017. The price surged dramatically as the platform gained popularity for its smart contract capabilities, driving demand for Ether (ETH) as a utility token. Ethereum reached a peak of around $1,400 in early 2018.
Post-2017 Correction: After the 2017 peak, Ethereum experienced a substantial correction, with prices dropping sharply in 2018, mirroring the broader cryptocurrency market downturn. However, Ethereum’s price began to stabilize and saw moderate growth in subsequent years.
Early 2020s (Not fully shown): While the graph ends around 2019, Ethereum's price would later experience a similar pattern to Bitcoin, with a significant rally in 2020-2021, largely driven by the explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), both of which heavily utilize the Ethereum network.

Solana (SOL) Closing Prices Over Time
